// --- Directions
// Write a program that console logs the numbers
// from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print
// “fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples
// of five print “buzz”. For numbers which are multiples
// of both three and five print “fizzbuzz”.
// --- Example
//   fizzBuzz(5);
//   1
//   2
//   fizz
//   4
//   buzz


////// SOLUTION 1 //////
function fizzBuzz(n) {

}
// This fxn is going to loop through every num between 1 and n to check
// if it is divisible by a certain number

////// SOLUTION 2 //////

module.exports = fizzBuzz;
